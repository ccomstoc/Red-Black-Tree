# Red-Black-Tree
Completed during my junior year for a data structures class, this project involves the implementation of a red-black tree in C++. The full project description is available at [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf).

Utilizing class templates, the structure accommodates the use of any object. Achieving this functionality required overloading operators. This can be seen in the class implementation for [Licorice](Licorice.cpp). 

An additional challenge presented itself with the implementation of the delete node function, which was offered as extra credit. Although our group attempted to tackle this task, time constraints prevented its completion, and therefore, it is not featured here.

The final trees are described as tree traversals in [Output1T.txt](Output1.txt) and [Output2T.txt](Output2.txt), and are visually represented in [output1Tree.png](output1Tree.png) and [output2Tree.png](output2Tree.png).
