# Red-Black-Tree
Completed during my junior year for a data structures class, this project involves the implementation of a red-black tree in C++. The full project description is available in [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf).

Utilizing class templates, the structure accommodates the use of any object. Overloading operators was a requisite for achieving this functionality. This can be seen in class implementation for [Licorice](Licorice.cpp). 

An additional challenge presented itself with the implementation of the delete node function, offered as extra credit. Although our group attempted to tackle this optional task, time constraints prevented its completion, and therefore, it is not featured in this submission.

The final trees are described as tree traversals in [Output1T.txt](Output1.txt) and [Output2T.txt](Output2.txt), and are visually represented in [output1Tree.png](output1Tree.png) and [output2Tree.png](output2Tree.png).
