# Red-Black-Tree
Completed this project in my junior year for a data stuctures class. It is an implementation of a red-black tree in C++. 
Project description can be found at [projectDesc.pdf](projectDesc.pdf). It should be noted that the project has an unconventional theme. 

Project uses class templates so theroreticly any object can be used in the structure. Operators had to be overloaded to make this possible. 
This can be seen in class implementation for [Licorice](Licorice.cpp). 

The delete node function was extra credit for this project. While our group attempted the extra credit, we were unable to complete it in the alloted time, so it is not included here. 

No easily readible print was created for this project, so the final trees can be found visualized in [output1Tree.png](output1Tree.png), and [output2Tree.png](output2Tree.png).
